regarding topic subscription
we've added manaually topic to subscribe in order to run the application
in producer there was a topic order created
in consumer it was not created and gave error
so we've added it manually in docker
1- open docker desktop
2- click on the container
3- choose kafka image
4- open terminal and write the following commands:
--navigate to bin folder:
cd /bin
--check if topic exists:

kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --list

--add the topic:
kafka-topics --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic order-created
